# TO-DO-LIST

Problem

-   use arrow functions wherever necessary
-   use es6 features

Create a TODO application:

-   add to do

-   remove an item

-   edit and update item

-   there should be a checkbox to indicate if the item has been done or not

-   If the item is done you should strike it off and not show it on the todo list.

-   There should be a completed task button to show and hide the task

Use these for reference:
